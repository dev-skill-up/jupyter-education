# Jupyter for Teaching

Included here are the resources I used for the talk:

* [Source notebook](talk.ipynb)
* [Slides](talk.pdf)
* [Notes](handout.pdf)

The thing that was hardest to demonstrate in
the talk was the power of interactivity.
You can see how to do full end-to-end
interactivity in
[the dedicated notebook](interactive-demo.ipynb).
